Renege Prediction model from candidate past information
Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
The given data contains various information regarding the applicants for a job. The company ABC wants to know what are the key drivers that influence the candidate joining/ not joining a company.
For this problem, we will build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic regression algorithm. In this problem, we will predict the status (Final joining status of candidate (Joined/Not-Joined)) variable (Dependent Variable) by using other variables like Age, DOJ extended, Notice Period, Gender etc. (Independent variables).
